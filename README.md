# Pokémon Search App

In this project, you'll build an app that searches for Pokémon by name or ID and displays the results to the user. To retrieve the Pokémon data and images, you'll use freeCodeCamp's PokéAPI Proxy.

- **Pokémon Images**: Shows the Pokémon's sprite image.
- **Error Handling**: Alerts the user if the Pokémon is not found.
- **Dynamic Content Update**: Clears previous search results before displaying new ones.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling the app.
